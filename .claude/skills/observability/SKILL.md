  How Navigator emits telemetry and how to debug a durable-execution failure fast. Every binary shares one seam,
  `telemetry::init` (stdout logs — JSON in prod — plus OTLP traces + metrics when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set),
  and everything lands in BigQuery (structured logs via a Cloud Logging sink; traces/metrics via an OTel Collector to
  Cloud Trace/Monitoring). Trigger when adding a span/metric/log field, instrumenting a handler or workflow, wiring a
  new binary's main, debugging a missing nightly/periodic job or a silent trigger, running `navigator doctor`, or
  touching the OTel Collector / BigQuery sink. THE ONE RULE, stated first because it is load-bearing: instrument
  identifiers and counts, NEVER content — a notation_id, service, outcome, duration, status code are fine; a client
  name, answer body, email address, or document body must never enter a span, metric, or log. Telemetry crosses the
  firm's trust boundary; client content does not. Skip for one-off println debugging.

# observability

The single most important rule, before anything else:

> **Identifiers and counts, never content.** A span attribute, metric label, or log field may carry a `notation_id`, a
> `service` name, an `outcome`, a duration, an HTTP status — never a client name, an answer body, an email address, or a
> document body. Telemetry leaves the firm's trust boundary; privileged client content does not. This is a standing
> engineering- and legal-council order. When in doubt, log the id and look the rest up.

## The seam

Every binary calls `telemetry::init("navigator-<name>")` once in `main` and **holds the returned guard to end of
`main`** (the drop flushes batched export — critical for short-lived trigger jobs). Never hand-roll `tracing_subscriber`
in a binary again; the crate is the one seam.

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` **unset** → human `fmt` logs to stdout, no OTLP. Zero cost (dev/CI/forks).
- **set** → JSON logs to stdout (Cloud Logging parses them) **plus** OTLP traces + metrics to the collector.

Wiring a new binary: add `telemetry.workspace = true`, then in `main` bind the guard to a name (never `let _ =`, which
drops instantly):

```rust
let _telemetry = telemetry::init("navigator-<name>");
```

**Opt-out by design.** The seam is for the *service* binaries — the 9 that wire it are `web`, `workflows-service`, the
four `*-trigger` jobs, `statutes-sync`, `statutes-trigger`, and `redirect`. The interactive / short-lived CLIs — `cli`
(navigator), `compass`, `navigator-lsp` — deliberately do **not** init it: their output is for a human at a
terminal (or an LSP client over stdio), not the lake, so instrumenting them would only add noise. Wiring a new *service*
binary is the rule; a new CLI staying stdout-only is the exception, and it is a choice, not an oversight.

## Instrumenting work

- Prefer instrumenting the **one shared chokepoint** over N call sites. Workflow triggers are instrumented once in
  `workflows::start_workflow` (span `workflow.trigger` + metric `navigator.workflow.trigger.fired{service,outcome}`), so
  every trigger gets it free.
- The two agent surfaces over the **one shared tool catalog** are each instrumented at their single dispatch
  chokepoint, so neither protocol is blind: A2A in `web::a2a` (audit spans), and `/mcp` in
  `mcp::server::handle_tools_call` (span `mcp.tool.call` + metric `navigator.mcp.tool.called{tool,outcome}`). Tool name
  and outcome only — never the `arguments`.
- Spans: `#[tracing::instrument(skip(secret_or_body), fields(service = ..., key = ...))]`. Skip bodies and tokens.
- Metrics: `telemetry::record_trigger_fired(service, outcome)` is the model — create the counter from
  `opentelemetry::global::meter(...)`, add with `KeyValue` labels that are ids/enums only. Safe to call when OTLP is off
  (the global meter is a no-op).
- Events: `tracing::error!(service, status = code, "…")` — fields are ids/counts; the message names the condition.

## Where it lands

Logs → Cloud Logging → a **BigQuery sink** (day one); traces + metrics → Cloud Trace / Monitoring via the **OTel
Collector**, whose **fail-closed redaction processor** (`allow_all_keys: false`) is the last line enforcing the
no-content rule. It complements the Iceberg archive: telemetry is the *operational* half, the archive the *data* half.

Full landing map, the sink, and the collector config live in
[`docs/observability.md`](../../../docs/observability.md#where-it-lands-bigquery--the-gcp-consoles) — don't restate the
architecture here.

**Locally** the same OTLP export lands in an in-cluster **Grafana LGTM** pod (Loki / Tempo / Prometheus) instead of GCP
— `navigator start-dev-server` wires host and in-cluster `web` to it and port-forwards Grafana to
`http://localhost:3000`. To *see* a span, metric, or trace you just emitted, use the `grafana-lgtm` skill; this skill is
the *emit* side.

## Debugging a missing periodic job (the playbook)

1. **`navigator doctor`** — names any trigger Job wedged in `ImagePullBackOff` / `CrashLoopBackOff` or Active-too-long
   (which, under a `CronJob`'s `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid`, silently skips every run) and any unready workload, each
   with the exact `kubectl` fix. First stop for a missing nightly/periodic job.
2. **BigQuery / logs** — `navigator.workflow.trigger.fired` by `service`/`outcome`: `rejected status=401` is a stale
   `RESTATE_AUTH_TOKEN`; `404` is a service not re-registered; `transport_error` is a hung/unreachable ingress.
3. **Restate Cloud console → Invocations** — did the worker run it; which step failed.
4. **`Heartbeat` email** (six-hourly) — its *absence* means durable execution itself may be down.

See [`docs/observability.md`](../../../docs/observability.md) for the full architecture and
[`docs/durable-workflows.md`](../../../docs/durable-workflows.md) for the durable-execution model.
